Collecting and preparing six months of transactional data (149k+ records, 11 fields) from January to June 2023.
Using Pivot Tables to explore and analyze the data to identify patterns and trends.
Building an interactive dashboard in Excel to provide insights into sales trends and customer behavior, aiding in data-driven decision-making.  

My goal was to transform this data into a dynamic dashboard to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for the business.
